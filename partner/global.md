Game Jolt's only responsibility to you in this regard is to track customer orders that occur through Links from your Content Channel and make regularly-generated automated reports to you showing the commissions due to you as a result of those Links. None of these reports will be audited. Game Jolt will have no obligation to provide you with any specific information relative to any customer, regardless of whether they access Game Jolt's site through the Link from your Content Channel.

9.2. **Limitations.** Game Jolt is not responsible for the failure to assign any sale or commissions to you if the sale or commission results from the improper formatting of the Link from your Content Channel.

##### 10. Compensation

10.1. **Affiliate Commissions.** Commissions will be paid to you based upon a percentage of sales made to users who access Game Jolt's site through your Links. The current commission rate is 10% of sales. Commissions will be calculated based upon the gross sales price, but not including any sales tax, late charges, collection costs, imports/export duties, and any other payment made to Game Jolt that is not the purchase price for the product that is purchased. Commissions will not be calculated based upon amounts that are attributable to credit card fraud, credits given to customers, bad debt write-off and returned goods. Game Jolt reserves the right to deduct from your Game Jolt Wallet included in your Account (your "Wallet") any commission that Game Jolt has paid that is for a product subsequently returned or, or for any other reason if any previous commission was overpaid or later subject to reduction.

10.2. **Refunds.** Users may request a refund within 3 days of their purchase of a product on the Game Jolt site. As a general policy, Game Jolt will only grant refunds to users if the purchased product does not actually start or fails to work because the purchased product is broken or non-functional, but we reserve the right to grant refunds for any reason. For more information, see our [Terms of Service ](http://gamejolt.com/terms).

10.3. **Changes to Commission Terms.** Game Jolt reserves the right to change and amend the commission rate structure at any time, in Game Jolt's sole discretion. You will be notified of any changes through your Game Jolt account.

10.4. **Link Click Required.** Commissions will only be paid on sales that are tracked through Game Jolt's online tracking system and indicate your Link as the source. There is no right to commissions if a user later returns to Game Jolt's site and makes a purchase through another link or source other than through your Link. You have no right to commissions based upon subsequent sales, even if the customer first arrived at Game Jolt's site through your Link. Commissions will only be tracked and paid when the user makes a purchase on the same visit that the user visits Game Jolt's site from your Link.

10.5. **Customer Payment Required.** Game Jolt will pay commission only upon our collection of purchase funds. You have no right to commissions until the applicable customer has paid Game Jolt in full. Only purchases that are made through Game Jolt's online ordering process will count towards commission calculations.

10.6. **Stripe.** Game Jolt uses Stripe Connect to process payments, for fraud prevention, and other services related to the Game Jolt site. By participating in the Program, you agree to Stripe's [Stripe Connect Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms), which is incorporated into this agreement by reference, including their collection and use of Personal Information, as detailed in both [Game Jolt's ](http://gamejolt.com/privacy) and [Stripe's]((https://stripe.com/us/privacy) Privacy Policies.

10.7. **Your Wallet.** Your commissions will be made in US Dollars, and are kept in your Game Jolt Wallet. Funds in your Wallet will be made available approximately 7 days after each order is placed by a user and processed, to allow for any refunds, chargebacks, or fraudulent payments. You can either withdraw this money from your Wallet directly to your PayPal account, or other method of withdrawal offered as an option by Game Jolt that you connect with your Account (the "Connected Withdrawal Method"), or use it to purchase products on the Game Jolt site.

10.8. **Connected Withdrawal Methods.** You may set up a Connected Withdrawal Method in your Account dashboard. However, Game Jolt **does not** have a way to redirect incorrectly-transferred funds once they have left your Wallet. Game Jolt is **not responsible** for any errors on your part in entering information about your Connected Withdrawal Method or otherwise that results in the loss of Wallet funds.

10.9. **Negative Amounts.** If any payment calculation results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable by Game Jolt to you under this agreement or any other agreement between us.

10.10. **Funds Withdrawal.** You can request to withdraw funds in your Wallet at any time, provided that the amount is over $.05. Game Jolt will make reasonable efforts to process such withdrawal requests nightly, but you agree and acknowledge that there may be delays. You can set a maximum amount of funds to be held in your Wallet, and any amount above that maximum will be transferred to your Connected Withdrawal Method at the end of each month. You can also set a minimum withdrawal amount, and when the amount of funds in your Wallet is greater than your Wallet maximum plus your minimum withdrawal amount, the remaining funds will be automatically transferred to your Connected Withdrawal Method.

You can set up your Connected Withdrawal Method, along with these maximums and minimums, in your Account dashboard.

10.11. **Tax Forms.** If you live in the United States and earn at least $600 in a calendar year, we will send you a 1099 form to the address you include in your Account.

10.12. **Survival of Payment Obligations.** Any payment obligations of Game Jolt will survive if this agreement is terminated. However, Game Jolt has no liability to make any payments if the payment information in your Account is not accurate, if the Account or any aspect of the Account is fraudulent, if your Content Channel or activities infringe on the intellectual property or rights of Game Jolt or any third party, of if the Account or your actions are in violation of this agreement or the Game Jolt Terms of Service in any way.
